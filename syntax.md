# Notation

 **⊢** is used for syntactic consequence. A **⊢** B just means that you can derive B from A, using A and some combination of your axioms and some applications of your inference rules. So for example, A; A → B **⊢** B means \(in our classical system\) there is a deduction sequence from the set of sentences, {A, A → B}, to B.
